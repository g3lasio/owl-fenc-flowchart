# Project Refactoring Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the refactoring work done on the owl-fenc-flowchart project. The refactoring focused on four main areas:

1. Implementing caching mechanisms
2. Adding error handling and resilience strategies
3. Updating microservices to use the new AI provider architecture
4. Implementing tests for the new components

## 1. Caching Implementation

### Tiered Caching

The project now uses a tiered caching strategy with three levels:

- **Memory Cache:** Fastest access, volatile storage
- **Persistent Cache:** Disk-based storage for persistence between service restarts
- **Distributed Cache:** Network-based cache (optional) for sharing across instances

```typescript
// Example of tiered cache usage
const value = await cacheService.get(key, [CacheTier.MEMORY, CacheTier.PERSISTENT]);
await cacheService.set(key, value, 3600, [CacheTier.MEMORY, CacheTier.PERSISTENT]);
```

Key features:
- Configurable TTL (Time-To-Live)
- Automatic memory cache cleanup
- Cache warming and prefetching
- Cache invalidation
- Cache hit/miss statistics

## 2. Resilience Strategies

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern has been implemented to prevent cascading failures:

```typescript
// Example of circuit breaker usage
const result = await ResilienceStrategies.withCircuitBreaker(
  async () => performOperation(),
  {
    circuitName: 'operation-circuit',
    failureThreshold: 3,
    resetTimeoutMs: 30000
  }
);
```

Key features:
- Named circuits to isolate different operations
- Three states: CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
- Automatic recovery after timeout
- Configurable failure thresholds

### Retry Strategy

Retry logic for transient failures:

```typescript
// Example of retry usage
const result = await ResilienceStrategies.withRetry(
  async () => performOperation(),
  {
    maxRetries: 3,
    baseDelayMs: 1000
  }
);
```

Key features:
- Configurable retry count
- Exponential backoff
- Combined with circuit breaker for comprehensive resilience

## 3. Updated Microservices

The following microservices have been updated to use the new AI provider architecture:

### UnstructuredInputServiceV2

- Uses the new AIServiceV2 for model management
- Implements tiered caching for results
- Uses resilience strategies for API calls
- Supports ModelSelectionStrategy for optimal model choices

### DeepSearchEngineV2

- Uses the new AIServiceV2 for completions
- Implements comprehensive caching
- Adds circuit breaker protection for AI calls
- Uses model selection for optimal AI usage

### AdaptiveLearningServiceV2

- Uses the new AIServiceV2 for adaptive learning
- Implements tiered caching for user profiles
- Uses resilience strategies for reliability
- Improves contractor profile management

## 4. Model Selection Strategy

A new model selection system optimizes AI usage based on:

- Task complexity
- Token count (context length)
- Cost vs. quality preferences
- Specific capabilities (vision, JSON output, etc.)

```typescript
// Example of model selection usage
const modelSelection = ModelSelectionStrategy.selectModel({
  taskType: TaskType.COMPLEX_REASONING,
  priority: ModelPriority.QUALITY,
  requiresJsonOutput: true,
  inputTokens: 5000
});
```

## 5. Testing

New tests have been implemented for:

- Circuit breaker functionality
- Tiered caching
- Distributed cache functionality
- Model selection strategy

## Conclusion

These refactorings have significantly improved the system's:

- Performance through caching
- Reliability through resilience strategies
- Flexibility through the new AI provider architecture
- Maintainability through comprehensive tests

## Recent Updates

### ServiceFactoryV2

A new ServiceFactoryV2 class has been created to better support the V2 microservices:

```typescript
const factory = ServiceFactoryV2.getInstance();
const deepSearchEngine = factory.createDeepSearchEngineV2();
const adaptiveLearningService = factory.createAdaptiveLearningServiceV2();
```

### TieredCacheService Improvements

The TieredCacheService implementation has been refined to work better with tests:

- Fixed constructor options handling
- Added proper getInstance() singleton method
- Improved cache statistics tracking
- Added proper error handling for distributed cache operations

### Fixed Model Selection Tests

The model selection tests have been updated with more flexible token estimation:

```typescript
static estimateTokenCount(text: string): number {
  if (!text) return 0;
  // Simple approximation: ~4-5 characters per token for English text
  return Math.ceil(text.length / 4.5);
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete tests for all new components
2. Add distributed cache support for Redis
3. Document additional microservices
4. Create example usage guides
5. Consolidate ServiceFactory implementations
6. Improve TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
